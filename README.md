Say, you have a page with text fields that may get hidden when the keyboard comes up, or sometimes, the text in the textfield may get too long that it cannot be seen all at once when we keep typing beyond the screen width size. Say, you have a page like this in your iPhone App

What if you want to type in the 'city' textfield? The keyboard will come up & hide the textfield. If you integrate IKTextBox, then typing in the 'city' textfield will open up a new page in which you can have a lot of screen-space to type & also, if the text gets long, you can see it all at once. This is what IKTextBox does when you try to type into 'city' textfield, let's say

See that you can also have a placeholder text in the textfield! & the placeholder text can be long too. 
Once you are done typing, touch 'am done' and the IKTextBox passes the typed-in texxt to your code (via its delegate) and you may fill that text in the textbox as seen below : the pin code now appears in the 'city' textfield
